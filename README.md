## Improved genetic algorithms for feature selection

Recently, researches on feature selection are mainly focused on two aspects: criteria and searching strategies. Searching for the best m features out of the n available for classification task is known to be an NP-hard problem. An exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets is usually unfeasible in practice due to the large amount of computational effort required. A wide range of heuristic search strategies has been used including hill-climbing, genetic algorithm [[1]](#1).

Here, let's focus on the genetic algorithm and its improvements for feature selection problem. Specifically, I deployed two modifications of genetic algorithms including Multiple Population Genetic Algorithm and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm.
